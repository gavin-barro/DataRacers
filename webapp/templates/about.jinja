  Formula One (F1) is the highest level of motorsport, featuring open-wheel, single seater cars that race at high speeds on circuits across the world. 
  Governed by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), F1 is renowned for its combination of cutting-edge engineering, driver skills, and 
  team strategy. Teams design their cars with strict regulations, focusing on aerodynamics, tire management, and power units. Races, known as Grand Prixs, 
  take place on diverse tracks ranging from purpose built courses to street circuits. Drivers accumulate points throughout the season, with championships 
  awarded for both drivers and teams based on overall performance.

    The F1LDB simplifies tracking of equipment by having a cohesive database that displays location and shipping information. With this, teams can 
    efficiently determine which equipment needs to be shipped for current/future races. Historical data on previous races can also be incorporated 
    for reference for the users of the system which can help improve planning for future races.
  </p>
  <p>
    Race Events are individual F1 Races. Each season features about 20 races occurring every week or two. The Team Kits are the equipment owned by 
    each individual team. They have the tires, mechanics equipment, uniforms etc. Our system does not care about the contents of each kit, that is 
    for each team to manage at their own level. Containers are the equipment owned by the F1 League and contain the necessary equipment to run each race.
